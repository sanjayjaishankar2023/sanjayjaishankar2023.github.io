        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p id="x1" class="text1">Hey there! I'm Sanjay Jaishankar, a Computer Science student with a strong passion for technology and design. I love working on creative projects that allow me to blend both logic and artistry, whether it's building websites, coding in Python, or designing graphics.

            With years of experience in Photoshop and Clip Studio Paint, I can bring ideas to life—whether it’s a stunning illustration, a polished UI/UX design, or professional photo editing. I take pride in creating visuals that are not only aesthetically pleasing but also meaningful and functional.
            
            On the tech side, I'm skilled in web development, building modern, responsive websites that look great on any device. My knowledge of Python helps me with automation, scripting, and problem-solving, making workflows more efficient.
            
            What excites me the most is the ability to combine creativity with technology—whether it’s crafting a visually appealing website or automating a tedious task with code. I'm always eager to learn, experiment, and push my skills to new heights. Let’s build something amazing!

            <p class="text1">The following project was made with the assistance of photoshop and Clip Studio Paint. I was asked to design a poster for a poetry event for my club. The theme being celebrating women and their achievements/contributions to society. Keeping that in mind I designed this poster with famous women poets keeping them centered making them contrast the background increasing their visibility. The background and textures complete the image.</p>

            <a href="https://aniveshguptaofficial.github.io/VTrade/"><img src="VTrade.png" alt="Project 2"></a>
            
            <p class="text1">This project is a group project I contributed to along with my teammates. I added valuable input to the javascript to the login and contact us pages of this website. I learnt creative ways to implement javascript to make it efficient and fit the theme of the rest of the project. This was a very unique challenge working with a team but it was an experience I value alot.
